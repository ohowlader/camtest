31) After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the feelings of animosity in America against Japan increased. By late 1945, the Allied leaders met in Germany with news of a secret new weapon, called the atomic bomb, created by American scientists, that was powerful enough to destroy an entire city. However, there were some feelings that the bomb was too powerful, and the leaders chose instead to send the Potsdam Declaration to Japan warning them to surrender. The Japanese military did not know about the atomic bomb and ignored the warning, so on August 6th 1945, an American bomber called the Enola Gay was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. This blast killed an approximated 70,000 people and destroyed more than eighty percent of the city, but the Japanese still did not surrender. The US dropped a second atomic bomb, and after a furious debate in the Japanese cabinet, the emperor of Japan announced a surrender. This day on the 14th of August became known as V-J Day, for Victory over Japan.



32) a & b) The approach to bring discrimination cases before the courts that I would have disagreed with most would have been using violence to gain attention. This approach only caused an uproar that required law enforcement and resulted in injuries of many people. Although it did bring attention, it brought the wrong sort of attention that they were seeking. The courts possibly would have been less eager to see their cases after acts of violence, since it only demonstrated rebellion.



33) a & b) President Lyndon Johnson proposed the development of a plan called the Great Society, which was a plan with an ambitious goal to improve the standard of living of every American. One of these important Great Society programs was Medicare. This plan helped to pay the hospital bills of citizens over the age of 65. Similar to this program, Medicaid gave states money to help poor people of all ages with medical bills. Along with this, he fought to help Americans who lived below the poverty line. The Economic Opportunity Act was passed in 1964 to set up job-training programs for the poor. It also gave loans to businesses poor sections of the cities and offered loans to poor farmers.
